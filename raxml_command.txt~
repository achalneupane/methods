These files are also in my dropbox.

##model test using AUTO option to determine best model; T1 indicates the step number 1; -T 20 indicates the number of threads; test_mpkk.fas is the aligned fasta.
raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 20 -m PROTGAMMAAUTO -s test_mpkk.fas -p 12345 -n T12

##This command will generate 20 ML trees on distinct starting trees and also print the tree with #the best likelihood to a file called RAxML_bestTree.T13. Now we will want to get support values #for this tree, so let's conduct a bootstrap search:
#Note: can use raxmlHPC-PTHREADS, raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-AVX or just raxmlHPC or any other tools avail#able; check the manual!


raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 20 -m PROTGAMMAVT -p 12345 -# 20 -s mitovirus-aa_Achal.fasta.uniq_clustalw_alignment_without_gap.fasta -n T13

#or depending on the output model from T12

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -T 20 -m PROTGAMMAJTT -p 12345 -# 20 -s mitovirus-aa_Achal.fasta.uniq_clustalw_alignment_without_gap.fasta -n T13


## need to tell RAxML that we want to do bootstrapping by providing a bootstrap random number seed via -b 12345 and the number of bootstrap replicates we want to compute via -# 100. Note that, #RAxML also allows for automatically determining a sufficient number of bootstrap replicates, in #this case you would replace -# 100 by one of the bootstrap convergence criteria -# autoFC, -# au#toMRE, -# autoMR, -# autoMRE_IGN.

Here, -# 100 indicates 100 bootstraps; we can now use them to draw bipartitions on the best ML tree as follows: 
raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -f a -x 12345 -T 20 -m PROTGAMMAJTT -p 12345 -x 12345 -# 100 -s test_mpkk.fas -n T14

#or different model for DNA; notice last JTT and CAT in these; PROT is for protein; GAMMA is selected model, JTT is the best model found



##Having computed the bootstrap replicate trees that will be printed to a file called RAxML_boots#trap.T14; 

##Now create ML tree for the performed 100 bootstraps and by using best tree generated from 
#above commands:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -m PROTCATJTT -p 12345 -f b -t RAxML_bestTree.T13 -z RAxML_bootstrap.T14 -n T15 

#The above call will produce to output files that can be visualized with Dendroscope:  RAxML_bipa#rtitions.T15 (support values assigned to nodes) and RAxML_bipartitionsBranchLabels.T15 (support v#alues assigned to branches of the tree). Note that, for unrooted trees the correct representatio#n is actually the one with support values assigned to branches and not nodes of the tree!

##Straight from the manual; need to modify for protein
#We can also use the Bootstrap replicates to build consensus trees, RAxML supports strict, majori#ty rule, and extended majority rule consenus trees:
strict consensus:            raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -J STRICT -z RAxML_bootstrap.T14 -n T16
majority rule:                   raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -J MR         -z RAxML_bootstrap.T14 -n T17
extended majority rule:  raxmlHPC -m GTRCAT -J MRE      -z RAxML_bootstrap.T14 -n T18

Hi, 

I am running raxml v8.0.26 as following:
raxmlHPC-PTHREADS-SSE3 -T 16 -f a -x 666 -m PROTGAMMAAUTO -p 666 -# autoMRE

and I see that before the bootstrapping and the topology searches the LG model has a slightly lower likelihood than the VT model. But I can't see which model was actually used for the bootstrapping and the topology search.

Example:

Stopped Rapid BS search after 600 replicates with MRE-based Bootstopping criterion
WRF Average of 100 random splits: 1.971813
Overall Time for 600 Rapid Bootstraps 8441.044932 seconds
Average Time per Rapid Bootstrap 14.068408 seconds

Starting ML Search ...

Hi Jon, 

automatic protein model selection is part of the general model optimization procedure and thus performed multiple times 
in the course of the topology search (that's why you see several "best scoring model" lines in the log). 

So based on your output, VT model was finally selected in the process of ML search, and for bootstrapping it seems to be 
LG (it must be clear from the full output, it's simply the last model reported before "Time for BS model parameter 
optimization" line). 

Best, 
Alexey

Thank you very much!
I suspected it was the last model reported, but good to have it confirmed!

Jon
